# Animal Classification App

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based application for classifying images of animals. The app leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuned with custom layers, to classify images into one of four Canadian animal categories. Built with Streamlit, the application provides a simple, user-friendly web interface for image uploads and model predictions.

---

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images into predefined categories.
- **Transfer Learning**: Uses VGG16 architecture with added dense layers to improve classification accuracy.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Enables quick deployment and interaction through a web app.
- **Large File Management**: Uses Git LFS to handle `.h5` model files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.9+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git LFS (for handling the large `.h5` file)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EliseZam/Animal_Classification_App.git
   cd Animal_Classification_App
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Git LFS** (if not already configured):
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs pull
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Run the Streamlit Application**:
   Launch the app locally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the App in Your Browser**:
   Once the server starts, use the following:
   - Local URL: `http://localhost:8501`
   - Network URL: Provided by Streamlit after startup.

3. **Upload and Classify**:
   - Upload an image of an animal.
   - View the model's prediction for the uploaded image.

## Files in the Repository
- **`app.py`**: Contains the code for deploying the Streamlit app.
- **`Custom_Structure_Animal_Classification_VGG16_v2.h5`**: Pre-trained model file for classifying animals.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

---

## Known Issues and Solutions
- **TensorFlow or Streamlit Errors**:
  Ensure the required packages are installed correctly. Use:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow streamlit
  ```
- **Large Model File Handling**:
  Use Git LFS to manage the `.h5` file.
